# Random-Password-Generator
A simple program I made that helps anyone that is looking to have an uncrackable password of any length! It also stores your password in .txt files to help you keep track of those passwords

A brief intro about me:
  My name is Abdallah! I am currently a CS student working towards my undergraduate degree. I love thinking about what I can code up into existence that could help make life, both mine and potentially others' much easier.

Short Description About This program:
  - Its written in python 3.7, but I used no external libraries, so it should work on older versions as well.
  - It initially started as a joke to my overly paranoid friend who is always worried about having his passwords figured out or       having some sort of malware on his computer that could potentially steal his steam account password and way way more.
  - The program was tested against some password scoring web apps, and the average score was around 99.89% strong.
  - This runs on shell, as I am still learing how to make GUIs, so do look forward to that in the future.
  - It runs on the python shell, it only takes one function with 6 parameters, and you have your unbreakable password, so you don't have to be tech savvy to use it. All you need to know is how to download python and run the program!
  - PLEASE read the README.txt file! As it has all the details you need to know on how to use it!
  
UPCOMING UPDATES:
  - Adding the ability to select what types of ASCII characters you need don't want to include in your password, as it has come to my awareness via my paranoid friend that some websites don't take all special characters.
