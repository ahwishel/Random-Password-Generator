# Random-Password-Generator
A simple program I made that helps anyone that is looking to have an uncrackable password of any length! It also stores your password in .txt files to help you keep track of those passwords

A brief intro about me:
  My name is Abdallah! I am currently a CS student working towards my undergraduate degree. I love thinking about what I can code up into existence that could help make life, both mine and potentially others' much easier.

Short Description About This program:
  - Its written in python 3.7, but I used no external libraries, so it should work on older versions as well.
  - It initially started as a joke to my overly paranoid friend who is always worried about having his passwords figured out or       having some sort of malware on his computer that could potentially steal his steam account password and way way more.
  - The program was tested against some password scoring web apps, and the average score was around 99.89% strong.

<h3>To Run:</h3>

Simply open a terminal and write: `python PassGen.py -l <length> -f <filename>` (no need to add .txt in the end)
